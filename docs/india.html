        <h1>Tamil Nadu unveils State Education Policy, commits to 2-language formula in departure from NEP</h1>
        <p>The story so far: Actor C. Joseph Vijay’s Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) has been facing multiple civil cases since it launched its party flag. While a representative of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) approached the City Civil Court in Chennai, objecting to the depiction of two trumpeting elephants in TVK’s flag, a trust titled Thondai Mandala Saandror Dharma Paribalana Sabai filed a civil suit in the Madras High Court alleging a “deceptively” similar colour scheme having been used in the flag.</p>
            <p> The first Assistant City Civil Court in Chennai on July 11, 2025 dismissed an application filed on behalf of BSP to grant an interim injunction restraining Mr. Vijay from using the two elephants in his party flag. The court also refused to grant the liberty to file a fresh application for an interim injunction against TVK’s flag.</p>

<p>It was Periyaranban alias R. Elangovan, the Tamil Nadu general secretary of BSP, who had filed an original suit in the city civil court against TVK president Mr. Vijay and general secretary Bussy Anand alias N. Anand early this year. According to the plaintiff, BSP was a national party which had been allotted an ‘elephant’ as its reserved election symbol across the country, but for Assam, by the Election Commission of India (ECI). Further, the BSP’s flag too had a picture of an elephant</p>
